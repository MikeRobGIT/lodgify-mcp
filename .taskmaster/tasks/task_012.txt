# Task ID: 12
# Title: Add Docker and Docker Compose Support for Lodgify MCP Server
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Containerize the Lodgify MCP server using Docker, provide a docker-compose.yml for local development and production, implement environment variable management, health checks, and document usage.
# Details:
1. Create a Dockerfile in the project root to build a minimal, secure container image for the Lodgify MCP server. Use a multi-stage build for production images to minimize size and include only necessary dependencies. Ensure the image exposes the correct port and sets up a non-root user for security.
2. Implement a docker-compose.yml file supporting both development and production configurations. Use build-time and runtime environment variables, mounting local source code for development and using built images for production. Include service definitions for the MCP server and any required dependencies (e.g., database, if applicable).
3. Integrate environment variable handling: ensure the MCP server loads configuration from environment variables (e.g., API keys, ports) and document required variables in .env.example. Support overrides via docker-compose.
4. Add a healthcheck to the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml, using the MCP server's health resource endpoint (e.g., curl http://localhost:<port>/health) to verify container readiness.
5. Write comprehensive documentation in the README covering Docker usage: building images, running containers, using docker-compose for local development and production, environment variable setup, health checks, and troubleshooting. Include example commands and configuration snippets.
6. Ensure compatibility with MCP client tools (e.g., Claude Desktop) by documenting how to connect to the Dockerized MCP server and referencing the relevant config.json setup.

# Test Strategy:
1. Build the Docker image and verify the MCP server starts successfully in both development and production modes.
2. Run docker-compose up and confirm the server is accessible, tools are registered, and environment variables are loaded correctly.
3. Validate healthcheck functionality: container should report healthy only when the MCP health resource responds as expected.
4. Test environment variable overrides via docker-compose and .env files.
5. Follow documentation steps to run the server in Docker and connect with an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop), confirming end-to-end functionality.
6. Check for security best practices: non-root user, minimal image size, no sensitive data in image layers.

## 3. Set up comprehensive environment variable management system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure environment variable handling for Docker deployments with support for development, production, and Docker secrets
### Details:
Environment setup: 1) Update .env.example with Docker-specific variables (DOCKER_PORT, NODE_ENV, LOG_LEVEL), 2) Create .env.docker for Docker-specific defaults, 3) Modify src/server.ts to prioritize env vars over .env file, 4) Add docker-compose.override.yml for local development overrides, 5) Document Docker secrets support for production API keys, 6) Implement validation for required environment variables at startup, 7) Create env-check.sh script for pre-flight validation, 8) Add support for environment variable interpolation in compose files

## 4. Configure health checks with MCP health endpoint integration [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Implement container health monitoring using the existing MCP health resource endpoint with appropriate timing and retry configurations
### Details:
Health check implementation: 1) Add HEALTHCHECK instruction to Dockerfile using curl or wget, 2) Configure check interval of 30s with timeout of 10s, 3) Set start period of 60s for initial startup, 4) Use endpoint 'http://localhost:${PORT}/health' or MCP health resource, 5) Add health check to docker-compose.yml with same parameters, 6) Implement graceful degradation if health endpoint fails, 7) Configure container restart policy based on health status, 8) Add health status logging for monitoring integration

## 5. Create Docker entry point script with signal handling [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop a robust entry point script that handles process signals correctly for graceful shutdown and proper stdio communication
### Details:
Create docker-entrypoint.sh: 1) Implement signal trapping for SIGTERM and SIGINT, 2) Forward signals to the Bun process for graceful shutdown, 3) Handle stdio streams properly for MCP communication, 4) Validate environment variables before starting server, 5) Set up proper file permissions for non-root user, 6) Implement retry logic for initial startup, 7) Add pre-start hooks for migrations or setup if needed, 8) Ensure proper exit codes are propagated to Docker
