# Task ID: 13
# Title: Audit Lodgify MCP Server for Complete v2 Endpoint Coverage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Cross-reference the Lodgify MCP server implementation against the official Lodgify API v2 documentation to verify all endpoints are present and identify any missing endpoints.
# Details:
1. Obtain the latest official Lodgify API v2 documentation, ensuring access to the full list of endpoints, their methods, parameters, and expected responses.
2. Catalog all v2 endpoints from the documentation, including details such as HTTP method, path, required parameters, and response schema.
3. Review the MCP server codebase and tool registration (especially in src/server.ts and lodgify.ts) to enumerate all currently implemented endpoints and their mappings.
4. For each documented endpoint, verify its presence and correct implementation in the MCP server. Pay special attention to authentication, parameter handling (including query/path/body), response formatting, and error handling.
5. Identify any endpoints that are missing, partially implemented, or have discrepancies in method, parameters, or response structure.
6. Document findings in a structured report (e.g., Markdown table) listing each endpoint, its status (implemented, missing, incomplete), and notes on any gaps or issues.
7. Recommend next steps for missing or incomplete endpoints, referencing best practices such as strict schema validation, comprehensive error handling, and support for pagination and rate limits where applicable[2][5].

Best practices:
- Use automated tools or scripts to parse and compare endpoint lists if feasible.
- Ensure endpoint coverage includes authentication, rate limiting, and error handling as described in the official docs[2][5].
- Version control all audit artifacts and findings for traceability.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manually cross-reference each endpoint in the Lodgify API v2 documentation with the MCP server implementation and tool registration.
2. For each endpoint, verify:
   - Correct HTTP method and path
   - Required and optional parameters are handled
   - Response schema matches documentation
   - Error handling and authentication are present
3. Document all findings in a Markdown table with endpoint, status, and notes.
4. Peer review the audit report for completeness and accuracy.
5. Optionally, use automated endpoint comparison tools to validate coverage and highlight discrepancies.
