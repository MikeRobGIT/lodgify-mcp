			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the test migration into subtasks covering: 1) Backup and dependency removal (remove Vitest from package.json and vitest.config.ts), 2) Convert test setup file to use Bun test globals, 3) Refactor mock utilities to use Bun's mocking API, 4) Update individual test files to use Bun test imports and APIs, 5) Replace Vitest-specific mocking patterns (vi.mock, vi.fn, vi.spyOn), 6) Migrate timer mocking to Bun equivalents, 7) Update test scripts and verify all tests pass, 8) Update documentation and CI/CD configuration",
			"reasoning": "Based on codebase analysis: Project has 7 test files all using Vitest imports and vi.* mocking utilities. The vitest.config.ts file needs removal. Tests use vi.fn() extensively (37+ occurrences) across utilities and test files. Package.json already has Bun test scripts but dependencies still include Vitest-related packages. Moderate complexity due to extensive mocking usage that needs API translation, but straightforward since test structure remains similar between frameworks."
