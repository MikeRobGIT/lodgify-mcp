			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the server refactoring into specific implementation phases focusing on: 1) Server class migration from low-level Server to high-level McpServer, 2) Tool registration enhancement with comprehensive metadata, 3) Capability declaration and advertising, 4) JSON-RPC error handling implementation, 5) Optional advanced features (notification debouncing, dynamic tool management), 6) File-based logging for STDIO transport, 7) Test suite updates and validation, 8) Documentation updates, and 9) Security review and environment variable management.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex refactoring task that requires significant architectural changes. The current server uses the low-level Server class from @modelcontextprotocol/sdk and needs migration to McpServer. Analysis shows 1200+ lines of server code with 30+ tool registrations, comprehensive error handling, and multiple API integrations. The refactoring involves multiple SDK API changes, metadata enhancements, capability declarations, error handling standardization, and optional advanced features. The complexity is high due to the need to maintain backward compatibility while implementing new patterns, update extensive test coverage, and ensure production readiness. The existing subtask structure already provides a good breakdown, confirming 9 subtasks is appropriate."
