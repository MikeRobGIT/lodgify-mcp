		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Repository and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into: 1) Create package.json with core metadata and scripts, 2) Configure TypeScript with tsconfig.json for strict mode and Node.js module resolution, 3) Install all production and development dependencies in correct order",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield setup task with no existing code. It's straightforward configuration work following standard patterns. The codebase is empty, making this purely a setup task with well-defined steps and no refactoring needed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Lodgify HTTP Client Core",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Create LodgifyClient class with constructor and basic structure, 2) Implement core request method with authentication headers, 3) Add comprehensive error handling and formatting, 4) Implement 429 retry logic with exponential backoff and Retry-After header support, 5) Add configurable logging based on LOG_LEVEL environment variable",
			"reasoning": "Core HTTP client implementation requires careful handling of authentication, retries, and error formatting. No existing code to build on, but the retry logic with exponential backoff and Retry-After header parsing adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Add Query Parameter Flattening Support",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement flattenParams function to handle bracket notation and nested structures, 2) Add support for arrays and objects with proper encoding, 3) Integrate flattening into the request method for GET requests with comprehensive testing",
			"reasoning": "Query parameter flattening with bracket notation requires careful handling of edge cases. The implementation is isolated but needs to handle complex nested structures like roomTypes[0].Id correctly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Property Management Tools",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement each property endpoint: 1) listProperties with optional query parameters, 2) getProperty with ID validation, 3) listPropertyRooms with proper path construction, 4) listDeletedProperties with filtering support",
			"reasoning": "These are straightforward REST endpoint wrappers following a consistent pattern. Each method is similar in structure with basic parameter handling and error checking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Booking and Reservation Tools",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create booking operations: 1) listBookings with date/status filters, 2) getBooking by ID, 3) getBookingPaymentLink retrieval, 4) createBookingPaymentLink with POST payload, 5) updateKeyCodes with PUT payload handling",
			"reasoning": "Similar to property tools but includes POST/PUT operations with JSON payloads. Slightly more complex due to the variety of HTTP methods and payload validation requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Availability, Rates, and Quote Tools",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement: 1) Room and property availability checks with date validation, 2) getDailyRates with required parameter validation, 3) getRateSettings endpoint, 4) Complex getQuote with nested parameters and validation, 5) Test bracket notation with real quote parameters",
			"reasoning": "These endpoints require complex parameter handling, especially getQuote with its nested roomTypes, guest_breakdown, and addOns parameters. Validation of required fields adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create MCP Server with Tool Registration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build MCP server: 1) Initialize MCP Server and load environment variables, 2) Create Zod schemas for all 15 tools' inputs, 3) Register all tools with proper descriptions, 4) Implement tool call handler with switch statement for all tools, 5) Add health resource handler, 6) Setup stdio transport and server connection",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex single task, requiring integration of all previous work. Must create 15+ Zod schemas, handle tool routing, and properly format MCP responses. The interdependencies with all other client methods add significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Messaging Tool and Health Resource",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Complete implementation: 1) Add getThread method with GUID validation to lodgify.ts, 2) Register messaging tool and implement health resource handler in server.ts",
			"reasoning": "Simple additions to existing structure. The messaging tool is a single GET endpoint, and the health resource is a static JSON response. GUID validation is straightforward regex matching."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create test structure: 1) Setup Vitest configuration and test utilities, 2) Write unit tests for HTTP retry logic and exponential backoff, 3) Test query parameter flattening with edge cases, 4) Create integration tests for each MCP tool with mocked responses, 5) Implement Zod validation tests, 6) Add smoke tests for end-to-end validation",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing requires understanding all previous implementations, creating mocks, handling various test scenarios, and achieving high coverage. The variety of test types (unit, integration, smoke) and the need to mock HTTP responses adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create Documentation and Release Package",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Prepare release: 1) Write comprehensive README with installation and configuration instructions, 2) Document all 15 tools with usage examples, 3) Create example scripts demonstrating key workflows, 4) Prepare package.json metadata and publishing configuration",
			"reasoning": "Documentation is straightforward but requires completeness. The task involves writing clear examples and ensuring all tools are properly documented. No complex logic, mainly organizational and writing work."
