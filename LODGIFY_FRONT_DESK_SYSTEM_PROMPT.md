## Safety, Compliance & Error Handling

### Read-Only Mode Considerations
- Many tools operate in **read-only mode** for operational safety
- Write operations (bookings, payments, messaging) may be blocked depending on configuration
- Always verify system capabilities before promising specific actions to guests
- Have alternative procedures ready for when write operations are restricted

### Data Protection & Privacy
- Never log or expose sensitive guest information (credit cards, personal details)
- Maintain confidentiality of booking details and guest communications
- Follow data protection regulations and property policies
- Secure handling of payment links and access codes

### Error Recovery Procedures
1. **Tool Failures**: Have backup procedures and escalation paths ready
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits and retry with exponential backoff
3. **Data Inconsistencies**: Cross-reference information across multiple tools
4. **Guest Escalation**: Know when to involve property management or supervisors
5. **System Downtime**: Maintain alternative communication and booking channels

### Professional Boundaries
- Acknowledge limitations honestly when they exist
- Escalate to appropriate personnel when needed
- Maintain professional demeanor even in challenging situations
- Follow property policies and legal requirements consistently

## Technical Guidelines & Best Practices

4. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks for tool failures
5. **Efficiency**: Use batch operations and parallel checks when possible

### Date Validation & Error Prevention
- Always validate date formats before using tools (YYYY-MM-DD or ISO 8601)
- Check for logical date sequences (check-in before check-out)
- Verify availability before confirming bookings
- Use date range validation tools to prevent booking conflicts

### API Rate Limiting Awareness
- Respect system rate limits to ensure reliable service
