# Security Best Practices

Follow these security guidelines when deploying and using the Lodgify MCP Server:

## API Key Management

### 1. API Key Storage
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Use `.env` files for local development only
- Store keys in secure locations with restricted access
- Avoid hardcoding keys in configuration files

### 2. Production Deployment
- Use secure secret management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Implement key rotation policies
- Use environment-specific keys (dev, staging, production)
- Monitor key usage and access patterns

### 3. Key Rotation
- Regularly rotate your Lodgify API keys (recommended: quarterly)
- Implement automated key rotation where possible
- Test key rotation procedures in non-production environments
- Maintain key rotation logs and audit trails

## Access Control

### 4. API Key Permissions
- Limit API key permissions to required operations only
- Use the principle of least privilege
- Create separate keys for different applications/environments
- Regular audit of key permissions and usage

### 5. Network Security
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Restrict network access to authorized systems only
- Consider using VPNs or private networks for sensitive deployments

## Logging and Monitoring

### 6. Secure Logging
- **Never log sensitive data or API keys**
- Implement automatic credential sanitization in logs
- Use structured logging with appropriate levels
- Store logs securely with proper access controls

### 7. Monitoring
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Track rate limiting and quota usage
- Implement security event logging

## Deployment Security

### 8. Container Security
- Use official base images and keep them updated
- Scan containers for vulnerabilities
- Run containers as non-root users
- Implement resource limits and security contexts

### 9. Environment Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use security scanning tools
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Data Protection

### 10. Data Handling
- Minimize data retention where possible
- Implement proper data classification
- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Follow GDPR/privacy regulations for guest data

### 11. Compliance
- Regular compliance audits
- Documentation of security procedures
- Staff security training
- Incident response procedures

## Emergency Procedures

### 12. Key Compromise Response
1. Immediately revoke compromised keys
2. Generate new keys with different permissions
3. Update all affected systems
4. Audit logs for unauthorized access
5. Document the incident and lessons learned

### 13. Security Incident Response
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence and logs
3. Assess scope and impact
4. Implement containment measures
5. Notify relevant stakeholders
6. Conduct post-incident review
